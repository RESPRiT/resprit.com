          I am an independent, interdisciplinary learning scientist + learner. I
          study learning concepts, apply them to my own learning process, and
          then communicate my findings and experience using creative work.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work is informed and inspired by the learning sciences (<abbr
            title='"learning by doing"'
            >constructionism</abbr
          >), computer science
          <abbr title='"user-interface design"'
            >(human-computer interaction)</abbr
          >, and the creative arts (<abbr title='"audio-visual storytelling"'
            >filmmaking</abbr
          >).

          Previously, I was a PhD student at Northwestern University as a member
          of Delta Lab, where I was co-advised by Haoqi Zhang and Nell O'Rourke
          under the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and Segal Design Research
          Cluster Fellowship; I voluntarily (and amicably) dropped out at the
          end of my third year.
